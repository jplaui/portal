## Portal: Time-bound and Replay-resistant Zero-knowledge Proofs for Single Sign-On 

### Access to Portal Benchmarks
You can reconstruct the benchmarks provided in the Portal paper if you change to the branch `paper_evaluation`. Please stick to the `README.md` found in the branch `paper_evaluation` to re-create the numbers. The `main` branch of this repository will be updated and changed as Portal will move to a L2 deployment.
