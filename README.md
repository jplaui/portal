## Portal: Time-bound and Replay-resistant Zero-knowledge Proofs for Single Sign-On 

### Access to Portal Benchmarks
You can reconstruct the benchmarks provided in our [research paper](https://tum-esi.github.io/publications-list/PDF/2024-ZKDAPPS-Portal.pdf) if you change to the branch `paper_evaluation`. Please stick to the `README.md` found in the branch `paper_evaluation` to re-create the numbers. The `main` branch of this repository will be updated and changed as Portal will move to a L2 deployment.
